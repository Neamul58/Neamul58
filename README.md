### Hi there 👋, I am Neamul Karim
#### Front-End Developer

I’m a Front-End Developer who helps businesses turn their ideas into high-performing, modern, and user-friendly websites. My work is focused on one thing: building websites that attract customers, increase conversions, and strengthen your brand online.

I specialize in creating clean, responsive, and SEO-optimized interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and WordPress. Whether you need a new website, a redesign, or technical improvements, I ensure your site loads quickly, looks professional, and delivers a seamless user experience across all devices.

What you can expect working with me:
✔️ Clear communication & fast response

✔️ High-quality code and modern UI design
✔️ SEO-friendly structure for better visibility
✔️ A website built to convert, not just look good
✔️ On-time delivery, every time
✔️ I will revise until your satisfaction
✔️ Customer Satisfaction is my First Priority 

I enjoy solving real business problems with smart, efficient front-end solutions — and I’m always focused on the results that matter most to you: growth, performance, and user engagement.
